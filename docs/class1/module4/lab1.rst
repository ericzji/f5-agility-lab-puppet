Lab – Puppet automation with f5_command
-----------------------------------

Following is a sample Puppet manifest file (site.pp) to run a TMSH command:  

.. Code::

	node bigip1 {

	f5_command { '/Common/tmsh':
	  tmsh  => "tmsh create ltm node 2.2.2.2",
	}

	}

Running the *puppet device -v --user=root* command will have the TMSH command apply to the F5 device.


.. Code::

	$ sudo puppet device -v --user=root --trace
